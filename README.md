# Fortanix Data Security Manager Secrets for Jenkins CI-CD

This Jenkins Plugin allows you to access and retrieve secrets (and keys) 
from Fortanix Data Security Manager for use in build environments.

## Usage

This plugin requires configuration of credentials at a global or folder level.
The build can then be configured to reference Fortanix DSM endpoint and a path
or label (name) of a secret (or exportable key).

![build-configuration](images/jenkins-build-config.jpg)

This configuration specifies the `API Endpoint` of Fortanix DSM 
server (or service) containing those secrets.

Additionally you will need to include a valid credential provider.

![app-credential](images/jenkins-credential-provider.jpg)

This credential can be specified at either the global, or project level. Separate
Fortanix DSM Apps can be mapped through the `API Key` to maintain role-based access
controls (RBAC) for projects authorized to access those secrets.

### Scripted pipeline

This script also can be used on scripted pipelines using the **withCredentials** instruction.


1.  With defaults, which will read specified **path** secret into the predefined environment variables: 
    `FTX_VAR`.
    
You just need to specify the `path` variable. 


Sample pipeline code:

 ```groovy
 withCredentials([fortanixDsmSecret(credentialsId: 'credentials_id',
                                     path: 'MY_SECRET_NAME')]) {
     sh 'echo $FTX_VAR | base64 -d'
 }
 ```

2.  With custom name, where you can control the name of the variables. Sample pipeline code:

 ```groovy
 withCredentials([fortanixDsmSecret(credentialsId: 'credentials_id',
                                     path: 'MY_SECRET_NAME',
                                     environmentVariable: 'SSH_KEY',
                                     )]) {
     sh 'echo $SSH_KEY | base64 -d'
 }
 ```
NOTE: if path variable/ custom env variable not base64 encoded, then you can remove `| base64 -d` from echo statement.
